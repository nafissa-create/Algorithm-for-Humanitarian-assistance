# Algorithm for Humanitarian Assistance 

## Context
This project was developed as a **mini project** in the course **Fundamentals of Computer Programming**.
It focuses on designing an algorithmic solution for equitable distribution of food and non-food assistance to displaced populations affected by armed conflicts.

## Project Domain
Human Resources / Humanitarian Assistance

## Objective
The objective of this project is to design a written algorithm that ensures:
- Fair identification of people in need
- Equitable distribution of food and non-food items
- Transparency in the distribution process

## Target Beneficiaries
- Displaced people who are victims of war conflicts  
- Project managers responsible for humanitarian assistance distribution

## Problem Description
In humanitarian crises, displaced populations often rely on limited resources.
The challenge addressed in this project is to design a structured and fair distribution process that:
- Identifies beneficiaries correctly
- Allocates sufficient quantities of items
- Ensures that all available goods are fully and fairly distributed

## Proposed Solution

### Inputs
- Personal information of displaced people
- Personal information of project managers
- Quantity of food and non-food items available per person

### Process
- Group displaced people by family and gender
- Determine quantities of goods allocated to each family based on family size
- Group beneficiaries by project manager
- Compute total quantities distributed by each project manager

### Outputs
- List of beneficiaries grouped by family, gender, and other parameters
- Quantity of food and non-food items allocated to each family
- Total quantity of goods distributed by each project manager

## Limitations and Future Work
The project identifies areas for further development, including:
- Designing a program to store and manage records
- Implementing the algorithm in code
- Developing a user-friendly interface for project managers

## Status
Completed (Algorithmic Project)
